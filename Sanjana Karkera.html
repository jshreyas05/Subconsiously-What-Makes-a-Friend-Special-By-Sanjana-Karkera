    <p> Hey! Im Sanjana & I believe all girls are born with wings within , & so we all deserve to fly unrestricted.<br>

The main agenda of the blog is to inspire girls to live independent.<br>

Don’t lock her within the cage of Patriarchy , Don’t fire her wings with Traditions, Don’t freeze her wings with Religion, Don’t pause her wings with doubt, & never ever cut her Wings Just for Worldly Misconceptions.<br>

Let her study , let her work . Let her try , let her win. Its her era , its her aura. She can bring much influence to the world.<br>

I also share my stories & opinions , the way I strive to achieve my independent wings.<br>

I don’t ask you to campaign or help all the girls around BUT yes I do ask you to empower yourself. And if your a man then help your Mother/Sister/Wife/Daughter be free. Every Independent girl leads to a better society.<br>

Please follow my blog to support me &  follow along to our Journey .</p>
