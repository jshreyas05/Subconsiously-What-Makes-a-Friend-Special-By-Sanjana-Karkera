  <p> <strong> (Just a shower thoughts/ philosophy article, me exploring my mind)
      Idk randomly this conversation hit my head that I had with a friend ,where I asked this person ‚Äúyou wouldn‚Äôt even share it to a close friend like me?‚Äù
      And this person( um let‚Äôs call this person umm nobita?)</strong></p>
  <p><em>So Nobita goes ‚Äúwoah am I your close friend?‚Äù
      I say ‚Äù arent you?‚Äù
      He says ‚Äúyes yes I am , I just thought you talk to everyone like this‚Äù
      (And we‚Äôve been talking for like a year)
      But that line is what got me into deep thoughts right now!! He isnt wrong, that‚Äôs true I talk to literally so many people and I even share my day to day random secrets with plenty people, and I got out to random places with people but I
      consider this one as close friendship but not all those people.
      Why is that.Where and how does my brain draw the line ? How do some of these people cross this level where I consider them a close friend?!</em></p>

  <p><em>I gave a lot of thought to this rn. Usually for people it‚Äôs the ones that</em></p>
  <ul>
    <li><em> They share their secrets to</em></li>
    <li><em>They talk on a everyday basis</em></li>
    <li><em>The people they hangout with</em></li>
  </ul>

  <p><em>But I literally dont have this! I mean I do ! But like I do these things with too many people , my bar to sharing stuff or talking or hanging out is different.
      As long as I know this person wont harm me or bore me to death I would hang out with anyone?
      I share my secrets with people that in no way can ruin anything for me by knowing it or the people that wont judge me or when they share a relatable secret.
      People think I have a lot of friends ,maybe I do maybe I dont? I dont talk to everyone tho but I guess I have a wider range of relatable people ,something like that..</em></p>

  <p><em>So so , my question to myself is
      ‚Äúwhy do I consider nobita , and a few other friends close or special?‚Äù
      Everyone wont be able to relate to this post ,definitely not introverts and not extroverts either.
      This is coming from a introverted extrovert.I like going out and I like being alone , i dont like having any specific friend having any control on my life or decisions or being obligated to this one best friend person.
      I‚Äôm the sitting alone in a cafe kinda person (who would still like being in a social place around people but preferably alone, you get what I mean? I hope soüòÇ)</em></p>

  <p><em>So the next thing I could think of having nobita as a close friend is this person helped me shift to a new place and that is not something I‚Äôd ask anyone to help with or anyone would do?
      But nah this arguement fails, I guess there could have been someone who would randomly help me out and probably would never grow close to me at all.ü§îü§î</em></p>

  <center>
    <img src="pic5.jpg" alt="" width="300">
    <p><em>(post thought: that is because I know anyone else that would help me would either have a ulterior motive or a obligation ,while Nobita truly did it out of friendship ,
        and honestly i haven‚Äôt come across many real friends in the past years ,this is pretty invigorating to me‚Ä¶)</em> </p>
  </center>

  <p> <em>So I think deeper and deeper.<br>
      I was wondering how to go about finding the answer so I made a list of all my close friends ,it was a long one at first ,then I made a list of things I cherished the most in my best friendships and narrowed out the list with people having all
      that in common( telling you this so maybe you could use this method to find out what are the most important things to you while defining your best friends).
      So here you go</em> </p>

  <h2><em><strong>SUBCONSIOUS FACTORS OF FRIENDSHIP</strong></em></h2>

  <ol type="1">

    <li> <em><strong>Friendship and Convenience.</strong>  </em> </li>
    <p> <em>I think the most important factor in a friendship is convenience,
        Your whole life situation and circumstances favouring or not favouring the friendship.
        If your girlfriend/boyfriend gets insecure of someone ,
        or your mom doesn‚Äôt like you hanging out with someone , its not convinient to have that them around.</em> </p>

    <p><em>Ofc we would never break off old friendship but when we‚Äôre talking about a new one, bruh so inconvenient to have you around.
        If a person is too clingy or too possesive , and you‚Äôre a solo person or always meeting new people ,having such a friend is inconvenient.
        If someone is a conservative conventional kinda person who always discourages you from doing rogue things while you‚Äôre a risk taker,
        they might be right at times but having such a friend is INCONVENIENT.
        Basically when a friend talks negative about things that are prioritized subjects in your life ,its INCONVENIENT, and no one wants that.
        Maybe some people like some amount of clingy, maybe its convenient for some people to have a set of friends they do literally everything with,
        i don‚Äôt think that fits anywhere into my equation. Each friends hold a different role in my life according to the relationship i have with them.
        I have a life of my own ,I like being solo in a lot of contexts, I would absolutely hate it if someone tries take over my whole life and try to be my
        everything deliberately. Cheesily enough ,I‚Äôm all for destiny and fate, just calmly watching where life takes us without being too fixated.</em></p>

    <li> <em> <strong>Communication and stability.</strong> </em> </li>

    <p> <em>When we know something isnt gonna last we tend to not give off a special place to that person. When we know we‚Äôre gonna leave the city or institution or company ,
        Or if we know someone isnt much of a social media person and hence them staying in contact line is mega blur (highly improbable),
        We already establish this is a temperory person in life. Who would like to get attached and connection to
        someone which is already bound to hurt you or create a void in your life soon?</em> </p>

    <li> <strong> <em>Mutual Respect.</em> </strong> </li>
    <p><em>The degree of respect between us isnt of much importance to me , but the existence of basic
        respect for each other is on the HIGHEST PEDESTAL.
        I cannot stand being friends with someone who doesnt talk respectfully to me.
        The abusive friendship is extremely rare in my life.<br>

        I‚Äôm not the kind of person to randomly dissapear or block out a close friendship but for this and this reason only ,
        the point I feel I have lose basic dignity in a relationship, I dont think twice before deleting anyone ,
        no matter how close we‚Äôve been or how long we‚Äôve been friends.Anyone making physical or characteristic comments or assumptions about me
        cannot continue to call themself my friend , and have no place in my life.
      </em></p>

<li> <strong> <em>The Initial truth</em> </strong> </li>

<p><em> There are eventually gonna be some lies or pranks or secrets in a friendship, which is all forgiveable in most cases ,but something that I cant get over is the initial lie.
  Getting to know that the one quality you cherished in a person when you met was a lie, realizing the one thing that fascinated you into it in the beginning you was a lie.
The one line that got you two talking was a lie. The one thing in life you both connected on was a lie? The one situation or circumstance that brought you together was manipulated.
 That is mindfucking for anyone , idk about others but I cant get past this one.</em> </p>

   <img src="10.jpg" alt="" width="500">

 <li> <strong> <em> Political Correctness / OpenMindedness </em> </strong> </li>

<p> <em>I understand the background and views of all the new people I meet is gonna be different ,the opinions are gonna be different.
   I don‚Äôt get offended in one statement ,I present my views and give the other person a chance to logically explain their point of view ,I am open to changing my views if there is something I havent seen or processed before and I expect this basic level of openness in all my friends too. I dont think I can be emotionally close to someone who firmly speaks against feminism ,makes homophobic comments , supports terrorism in any minute way.
Now I do know these topics too can have one actual point or two to logically debatable over ,
but I dont think I can bear someone who has a blind belief ,who cant justify their wrong choices or people who have the
stupidest argument in the eyes of science.One statement like that and I know there‚Äôs no more point in any debate,
I wouldn‚Äôt abandon someone for being politically incorrect ,I do know they might be a good person in other ways in life but when
I hear something like that I immediately know this is not a forever kinda friendship for me.</em> </p>

<li> <strong> <em>  THE CRAZY SIDE </em> </strong> </li>
<p> <em> Another important thing that makes me feel supa supa close with someone is being able to
   be crazy with them.And honestly idk how my brain decides to be crazy with some people.There are some friends
   in my life that match all the above keys but somehow my brain never gets around being comfortable enough to
   tell t-hem crazy stories or do crazy stuff with them ,I remain too silent and introverted and formal with some people
   with no definite reason.Either they are too crazyyy for my crazy or I feel judged, demotivated or supressed by them.
   I gotta be completely fully crazy me with my bffs along with them being able to show me their own psychotic side too!</em> </p>

<li> <strong> <em>The ONLINE OFFLINE NOLINE Compatibility</em> </strong> </li>
<p> <em> This plays a biggg role in being friends forever , this point is where most friendships come to any end for me. I‚Äôve been writing and updating this article for over a month now and new points keep hitting. The most important point on how some friendships have survived really really
  long with me is this. I have some friends that dont chat well, or are just not the chat intimate kinda person? So when I move away it all
  just comes to an end,since I have moved in the previous years ,that‚Äôs quite relatable.Im not bestfriends with the same people anymore ,
because um it doesnt feel that kinda close anymore with them just online. Counterpart to this are the online besties that you just cant
connect with in real life, I‚Äôve had this happen to me too ,some people seem the dearest to me online ,like i could share anything with them ,
but irl it‚Äôs just blunt awkwardness.
This is why I always try to keep my online friends just online. The ‚Äúfriends forever‚Äù only becomes practical when a person can actually survive
 talking irl and well as just online and even NO LINE meaning sometimes not being able to talk at all with reasons or no reason at all and still
 feel kinda connected whenever we interact next time ,and these people are rare af.And this is not a quality that one should possess ,
 hell even I cant do this to everyone, its more of a godlevel compatibility that only exists with very few people , i mean enjoying someone‚Äôs
  company in real life as well as having deep conversations with them on chat! How rare is that?.We may be bestfriends online or in college ,
  but being compatible in every way is definitely not something that happens with everyone.</em> </p>

</ol>
<br>
<p> <strong> <em> So yeah I guess these are some of the point on how I subconsciously have made my close friends ,this is what makes nobita and a bunch of other people more special,more close to me than others.‚ù§Ô∏è I cherish the couple of friends like that i have in my life‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è I‚Äôve never made a list like this before choosing my friends ,Infact as you know, I talk to everyone ,but you guys ,the gems of the people I‚Äôve recieved in life have set the bar super high‚ù§Ô∏è Hopefully with this new found clarity , I wouldnt emotional invest myself or waste my time on someone who doesnt match my frequency. This list is not my checklist and hell it keeps updating , but its inspired by my close friends ,acknowledging how amazing theyve been to me and the amazing value they bring to my life‚ù§Ô∏è Also acknowledging how simple and basic it is to be a genuine friend to anyone at all ,you dont have to possess any special skills or come with any special privileges at all , all you have to be is a good decent human being and have your own life!‚ù§ üôÇ </em> </strong> </p>
